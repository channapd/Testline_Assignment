## Project Overview

This project analyzes quiz performance data for students to provide personalized recommendations for improving their preparation. Student performance is evaluated by topics, difficulty levels, and response patterns using analytics and visualizations. The ultimate goal is to help students identify weak areas, track improvement trends, and receive actionable insights to enhance their learning process.

## Setup Instructions

1) Prepare Input Data:

* Place the Current Quiz Data and Historical Quiz Data files (in .csv or .json format) in the data folder.
* Update file paths in the script if needed.


2) View Outputs:

* Key visualizations will be displayed on execution.

## Approach Description

1) Data Loading:

  * Load current and historical quiz data from the provided files or API endpoints.


2) Performance Analysis:

  * Calculate metrics like accuracy, negative scores, and mistake correction rates for each topic.
  * Identify trends in student performance across quizzes (e.g., improvement or decline).


3) Insight Generation:

  * Highlight weak areas where accuracy is low or negative marking is high.
  * Identify strong topics based on consistent accuracy and low errors.
  * Track improvement trends for specific topics or question types.


4) Recommendations:

  * Generate actionable steps for students based on their performance metrics.
  * Suggest specific topics and question types to focus on for improvement.
  * Provide creative labels and insights to help students understand their learning behavior.


5) Visualizations:

  * Use graphs and charts to present trends, strengths, and weaknesses in an easy-to-understand format.
  * Save these visualizations for reports or direct sharing.
